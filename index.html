  <section id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Our inspiration for Xfotos comes from our personal experiences with photo editing tools that were either too complicated or lacked essential features. We realized the need for a reliable and user-friendly platform that empowers individuals to bring their creative vision to life through image editing.

        Xfotos is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, where we had the opportunity to apply our skills and passion for web development to create a practical and impactful application. Throughout the development journey, we learned valuable lessons, collaborated closely as a team, and dedicated countless hours to refining Xfotos into the remarkable tool it is today.
